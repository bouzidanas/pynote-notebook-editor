# Some information about the explanations folder

This folder contains explanations and documentation related to the Pynote Notebook Editor project.

> [!NOTE]
> The majority of these explanations were, at some point, **generated by AI** based on the codebase and may not be fully accurate. I will, over time, work on making them my own. **They will be reviewed and corrected before release.** AI generation is often relied on to take notes or document ideas/concepts when they come to mind without interrupting the coding flow and pulling me away from work in-progress.
