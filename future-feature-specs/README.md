# Some information about the future-feature-specs folder

This folder contains **specifications for future features** that are being considered for the Pynote Notebook Editor project. These specifications are **not yet implemented** and are provided for informational purposes only.

> [!WARNING]
> The content in this folder is mostly if not completely **generated by AI** based on ideas and concepts related to the project and may not be fully accurate or feasible. They are intended to outline potential features, designs, or implementations that could be added in the future. **They will be reviewed and validated before any implementation takes place.** 
What I have an idea for a feature, I often dont have the time to fully flesh it out right away or write a full spec myself, so I prompt AI with a stream of consciousness description of the idea and any specific requirements or constraints I have in mind. The AI then generates a more formal specification document that I can review later when I have time to consider adding the feature. This allows me to capture ideas without interrupting my current workflow.
